        <p>As the protagonist of the short story, the wife is the central character that Hemingway carefully portrayed throughout the story. The loneliness, vacancy that accompanied her as well as her contradicted feelings about her own feminine identity are reflective of social problems at the time and shed light on the theme of the story.</p>
<p>There are multiple signs from the story showing that the wife was lonely and unhappy. When she spotted the cat crouching in the rain, she felt pitiful for it and decided to come out and get it. The cat <span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-end"><h-inner>“</h-inner></h-char></span>trying to make herself so compact that she would not be dripped on<span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-beg"><h-inner>”</h-inner></h-char></span> shows its vulnerability in the face of the rain. As a result, the wife’s insisting on getting the cat indicates that she identifies with the cat’s loneliness and helplessness. On top of that, when she found out the cat had disappeared, she came back in with disappointment and complained to her husband about her desires that were not satisfied. She said apart from having a cat, she also wanted to grow long hair, eat with her own silver, the weather be spring and have new clothes. However, those wishes are confronted by her husband’s cold response <span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-end"><h-inner>“</h-inner></h-char></span>shut up and get something to read<span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-beg"><h-inner>”</h-inner></h-char></span>. These outpouring wishes buried in her mind reveals the unhappiness of her life.</p>
<p>The wife’s unhappiness was resulted from her estranged relationship with her husband George. From the wife’s point of view, George was unable to recognize and satisfy her emotional needs. When she said she was to get the cat in the rain, although George offered to do it for her, after being turned down he went on reading in bed and hardly paid any attention to her. Also, when the wife expressed her long list of wishes that weren’t satisfied, George was barely able to speak any word of comfort to her. Perhaps it is this distance and alienation from her husband that made the wife want to seek connections with other people around her, such as the hotel keeper. The wife liked the way the hotel keeper <span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-end"><h-inner>“</h-inner></h-char></span>wanted to serve her<span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-beg"><h-inner>”</h-inner></h-char></span>, indicating that she lacks such attention from her husband. Despite the strong affection the wife holds toward the hotel keeper, their relationship remained remote and formal. The wife’s emotional needs of care and attention cannot be fulfilled, and we could feel the gloom and vacancy in her heart.</p>
<p>The wife’s dynamics with male characters in the story is also reflective of people’s concepts of sexuality and women’s predicaments in society. The husband’s indifference toward his wife’s needs embodies the prevalent machismo idea in society. Upon hearing that his wife wanted to grow her hair out, George replied that he <span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-end"><h-inner>“</h-inner></h-char></span>like it the way it is<span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-beg"><h-inner>”</h-inner></h-char></span>, implying that to him the only thing that matters is what he thinks of his wife’s appearance, instead of how she would like her appearance to be.This traditional idea of femininity is also embodied in the wife’s lack of naming throughout the story, while her husband was given the name <span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-end"><h-inner>“</h-inner></h-char></span>George<span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-beg"><h-inner>”</h-inner></h-char></span>. Also, the narrative voice is mostly masculine. By referring to the protagonist as either the <span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-end"><h-inner>“</h-inner></h-char></span>wife<span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-beg"><h-inner>”</h-inner></h-char></span> or the <span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-end"><h-inner>“</h-inner></h-char></span>girl<span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-beg"><h-inner>”</h-inner></h-char></span>, it seems to judge women mainly by their subordinate role in marriage or their mental immaturity.</p>
<p>Apart from the unfair judgments society made on women, the wife herself tends to be ambivalent about her own feminine identity. Her short hairstyle seemingly symbolizes the progressive trend in society that rebels against the traditional standard of being a woman, but she is now attempting to embrace a more traditional view of femininity by growing her hair out. This implies that although social transformations have changes things on the surface, those deeply-rooted conventional concepts of femininity are still making far-reaching influences.</p>
<p>Another characteristic of the wife is her obliviousness toward symbols of WWI around her. Being an American traveling in Italy, she had never gone through the destruction and deprivation of the war herself and was totally ignorant of the war monument which attracted Italians traveling a long way to see it. Her desires of the cat and of new clothes seems mundane in contrast of the cataclysmic destruction brought by the freshly ended war. Through this specific design of setting, Hemingway leads us to think about the influence of war on people’s lives and the gulf between people of different cultural experiences.</p>

        <p>As a breathtaking and intriguing science fiction horror story, there are both external and internal conflicts in Ray Bradbury’s Mars is Heaven!. Ray utilized rich description of the settings as well as multiple literary devices such as simile and foreshadowing to build up the conflicts, while also contributing to the development of the story and the delivery of its theme. This essay mainly focuses on analyzing the conflicts in the story and the way Ray constructed them.</p>
<p>The external conflict of the story is the conflict between Martians and humans. It turned out at the end of the story that Martians used telepathy to kill the travelers from Earth in a smart way. The Martians took advantage of Earth people’s nostalgia and emotional connections with their loved ones and successfully lowered their guard. This shows that mind control could be easily done if it’s associated with the things that we love and trust. Ray used detailed description of settings in the story to show the way Martians carried out their strategy. They played pieces of music from these Earth people’s childhood such as Beautiful Dreamer and Roaming in The Gloaming to bring up their nostalgic feelings. Natural sounds such as <span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-end"><h-inner>“</h-inner></h-char></span>buzzing of the spring bees<span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-beg"><h-inner>”</h-inner></h-char></span> and <span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-end"><h-inner>“</h-inner></h-char></span>tinkle of ice rattling in a lemonade pitcher<span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-beg"><h-inner>”</h-inner></h-char></span> eased their nerves and made them feel safe. Observing that the town was <span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-end"><h-inner>“</h-inner></h-char></span>peace and quiet<span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-beg"><h-inner>”</h-inner></h-char></span>, Captain John felt that <span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-end"><h-inner>“</h-inner></h-char></span>the fresh look of things was a balm to the soul<span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-beg"><h-inner>”</h-inner></h-char></span>. Gradually lulling Earth people through this peaceful atmosphere and exploiting their emotional weakness, Martians easily controlled their mind in the form of the things they trusted and loved. Therefore, the story reminds us that we should always be attentive of mind control in the forms that are seemingly friendly and harmless, and not let our mind be fooled by the kind disguise of our enemies.</p>
<p>Apart from external conflict, there are also internal conflicts of the protagonist, Captain John Black in the story. There’s an internal struggle in his heart between rationality and emotion. At the beginning, John and his crew were all suspicious of what they saw and keenly developed various theories to explain it. However, after seeing the face of their beloved ones, delirium and delight took over them, making them hardly able to remain clear-headed and think of their occurrence skeptically. Simile is used several times in the story to describe the overwhelming power of emotion over people’s judgement and actions. Upon hearing that mom and dad were alive, Captain John <span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-end"><h-inner>“</h-inner></h-char></span>almost fell to earth as if hit upon the chest with a mighty weapon<span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-beg"><h-inner>”</h-inner></h-char></span>. After the long day of reunion with his family, he felt <span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-end"><h-inner>“</h-inner></h-char></span>soaked to the skin with emotions<span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-beg"><h-inner>”</h-inner></h-char></span> like <span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-end"><h-inner>“</h-inner></h-char></span>being in a thunder shower without an umbrella<span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-beg"><h-inner>”</h-inner></h-char></span>. The influence of emotional shock is compared to physical strikes such as being hit or getting soaked in the rain, indicating that it could actually exert enormous impact on the functionality of one’s mind to think critically and logically. Emotions made the crews forgot about their military rules, and eventually made them lost all their guard against Martians. This internal conflict indicates the difficulty of maintaining one’s rationality in the face of strong emotional impacts.</p>
<p>Another internal conflict is fantasy versus reality. Just as Captain John had suspected, Earth people’s reunion with their dead loved ones is just a dream that is too good to be true. It’s like beautiful yet fragile foams that are bound to break. If the travelers themselves refuse to break it and embrace the cruel reality, their enemies, the Martians will break it up for them and use it to destroy them. The Earth people faced the dilemma of whether they should numb themselves in the beautiful fantasy made up by Martians, or they should wake up and face the tough reality.</p>
<p>However, upon seeing the face and holding the hands of their loved ones, the joyfulness and fulfillment of these travelers are undoubtedly immense and also of great significance to them. Although their experiences are made-up, their feelings and emotions are real. This further brings up the question that even if the sweet fantasies are merely traps and dreams, would it still be a good choice to just believe and enjoy it, if the gained emotional values could outweigh the price of the loss of reality and rationality? After all, what is the definition of reality? If all one wishes is to meet his dead family for a second time, and would rather die after it, wouldn’t it be worthwhile to have this last experience on Mars? I think perhaps these questions are remained open-ended by Ray for his readers to think and answer by themselves.</p>
